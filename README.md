#Memory cards

=>Each card has a question and an answer.
=>You can add a new card, and write whatever you want inside it.
=>Each card is stored in localstorage as a object.
=>There is a button you can use to delete all the cards. Soon i'll add another button on each card to delete it individually.

ENJOY IT.
